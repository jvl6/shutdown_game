# shutdown_game
Pointless program that has you catching the window to score a certain amount of points before the timer runs out. 

You've got a minute to score 250 points. If the timer runs out, your computer shuts down.

It only works on Windows, and it's got compilation errors (but, mysteriously, works perfectly on NetBeans).
